          Hades is a roguelike game from Supergiant Games, creators of Bastion,
          Transistor, and Pyre. You play as Zagreus, immortal son of Hades, on
          his quest to escape from the underworld, fighting through many angry
          lost souls along the way. Death is a mere inconvenience for Zagreus,
          returning to Hades' palace each time to reflect in the Mirror of Night
          and try again. Receive Boons from the other gods of Olympus and find
          treasures to aid in each escape attempt.
